# Groove Sampler

An advanced sampler and sequencer for mobile browsers, featuring a powerful groove engine for creating unique rhythms. Record sounds, arrange patterns, and manipulate your beats with detailed controls, including support for microtonal world music scales.

## Key Features

-   **4 Banks & 32 Pads**: Organize your sounds across four banks, each with eight sample pads.
-   **32-Step Sequencer**: Create complex rhythms with a 32-step sequencer featuring A/B parts with independent lengths, resolutions, and loop counts.
-   **Per-Bank Groove Engine**: Apply unique groove templates and depths to each of the four banks independently, allowing for complex polyrhythms. The groove settings are saved with each pattern.
-   **Microtonal Engine & World Scales**: Go beyond 12-tone music with a cents-based pitch engine and a huge library of authentic world scales (Maqamat, Ragas, Gamelan, and more).
-   **Comprehensive PC Keyboard Control**: Control the entire application with your computer keyboard. Play pads, perform melodies with a scale-aware keyboard, change octaves, keys, and scales, and access UI functions on the fly.
-   **Sampling & Drum Kits**: Record your own sounds directly through the microphone, or load pre-made classic drum machine kits.
-   **Channel Mixer & Master FX**: Mix your four banks with dedicated volume faders, pan controls, and Mute/Solo buttons. A master compressor and safety clipper are included on the master channel to add punch and prevent clipping.
-   **MIDI Control & Templates**: Comprehensive MIDI Learn system with multi-parameter mapping, bank-wide assignment mode, and template management for live performance. Assign MIDI CCs to any parameter, save mappings as templates, and switch between templates instantly during performance.
-   **Project Saving**: Save and load your entire projects, including all samples, patterns, and settings.
